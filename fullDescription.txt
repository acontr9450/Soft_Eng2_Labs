This is the first paragraph for the full description text with some modifications now.Not much to include here but words to make it seem like a paragraph. I think I'll add another sentence or two 
to make it look like a full paragraph. Last line was deleted
Onto the next paragraph, this one will be much shorter than the last one because as I write more paragraphs I will be running out of stuff to type. I guess I'll give this paragraph one or two more 
sentences to make it seem close the first paragraph.This line is new.
Now the last paragraph, the conclusion one. This one will be the conclusion to the full description text that is to have exactly three paragraphs.New line here. Deleted line here.
